# DC Farmer Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Static-First

All content must be served as static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images). No server-side processing required. The website must be deployable to any static hosting service without modification.

### II. Responsive Design

The website must be mobile-friendly and responsive across all common device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). All pages must be accessible and functional on screens from 320px width upward.

### III. Performance

Page load times must be optimized for fast delivery. Minimize HTTP requests, optimize images, and reduce file sizes. Target initial page load under 3 seconds on standard broadband.

### IV. Accessibility

Follow basic web accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 Level A minimum). Use semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, alt text for images, and sufficient color contrast.

### V. Maintainability

Code must be clean, well-organized, and easy to update. Use clear file structure, consistent naming conventions, and comments where necessary. Keep dependencies minimal.

## Technical Standards

### File Structure

- Organized directory structure (e.g., `/css`, `/js`, `/images`, `/pages`)
- Clear separation of concerns (content, styling, behavior)
- Consistent naming conventions (lowercase, hyphen-separated)

### Browser Compatibility

- Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers where possible

### Content Standards

- Valid HTML5 markup
- Proper meta tags (description, viewport, charset)
- SEO-friendly structure (proper headings, semantic markup)

## Development Workflow

### Version Control

- All changes committed to Git with clear commit messages
- Main branch represents production-ready code
- Test changes before committing

### Quality Checks

- Validate HTML/CSS before deployment
- Test on multiple devices/browsers
- Check all links and resources are working
- Verify responsive behavior

## Governance

This constitution defines the minimum standards for the DC Farmer website. All changes must maintain these principles. The website must remain simple, fast, and accessible while serving the needs of the darts club community.
